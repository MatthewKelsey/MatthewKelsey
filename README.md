# Matthew Kelsey

Hi there, I'm Matt! :wave:
I'm a passionate programmer, educator, guitarist, and avid traveller who loves to create Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). I have a vast background in education and have spent many years teaching a variety of subjects to students of all ages.


<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar and travelling. Music has been a passion of mine since I was young, and I love playing everything from classic rock to bossa nova. Travelling is also a huge passion of mine, and I've been fortunate to visit and live in many different countries and experience different cultures.

<h2>My Recent Projects</h2>
One of my favorite things to do is to create PWAs. I love the challenge of building fast, responsive web applications that can work offline and provide a seamless user experience. Some of my recent projects include:

Babble-Island: - A pixel art language learning game. <br>
Picture This: https://github.com/MatthewKelsey/Picture-This - A place for sharing photos through communal and private albums.<br>

<h2>What I'm up to</h2>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Story Time. A reading app for kids that allows them to create and share their own stories with the world!<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning with python.
